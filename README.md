# SimpleBankSystem
While learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#, I developed this Windows Forms application as a BankAccount management system. The project demonstrates the use of core OOP principles, including:

Classes & Objects – for creating and managing different bank account entities

Inheritance – to extend common account behavior across different types of accounts

Encapsulation – to protect and manage account data securely

Polymorphism – to implement flexible and reusable methods for different account types

This project helped reinforce my understanding of OOP by applying the concepts in a practical, interactive application
